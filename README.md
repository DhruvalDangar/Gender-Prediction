# Welcome to Streamlit :wave:

**The fastest way to build and share data apps.**

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into sharable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It’s all Python, open-source, and free! And once you’ve created an app you can use our [cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to deploy, manage, and share your app!
